     <h1>These are my notes about HTML!</h1>
     <h2>The Web</h2>
     <p>The web is a collection of documents written in HTML along with other resources such as images and videos, as well as programs and services that interact with the documents and resources.
     <br> <strong>Hypertext:</strong>a form of text in which documents can refer(link) to other documents and resources. The web is a hypertext system.</p>
     <p> The <strong>browser</strong> gets web pages by communicating with servers over the internet.<br>
         <strong>Servers</strong> are computers that have programs running on them which answer a browser's request</p>
     <p><strong>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP):</strong> the rules for how the requests and responses between the browser and server work. HTTP= insecure and HTTPS= secure.</p>
     <h2>HTML</h2>
     <p><strong>HyperText Markup Language(HTML):</strong>The language that provides the structure and text of web pages.</p>
     <h3>Things To Remember:</h3>
     <p><strong>Syntax:</strong>Grammar rules of a language.<br>
     <strong>Formalism:</strong>Computers take code literally, and will only do exactly what you tell it to do.<br>
     <strong>Nesting:</strong>Bits of code going inside other bits of code in an orderly way. Elements have to go completely inside each other. They can not overlap.<br>
     <em>There's lots of nesting in this file!</em>
     <strong>There's a lot of help!</strong>Make sure to use tools like documentation, or your favorite search engine if you need to.<br>

    <p>HTML is written in text. The layout of a webpage seen by the user is put together by the web browser based on the code in the text file.</p>
    <div><strong>Text files contain:</strong>
          <ul>
             <li>Letters</li>
             <li>Numbers</li>
             <li>Symbols
             <li>Spaces<li>
         </ul>
    </div>
    <p>Text editors are used to create and edit text files. Each text editor has it's own features like syntax highlighting and line numbers.</p>
    <p>Save HTML files with .html at the end of the file name.<br>
    In HTML there is text that the user will actually read in their browser. 
    <strong>Markup:</strong>text that has a special meaning, tells the browser what that text should look like or how it's arranged.
    And within markup, there can be... References to include other documents and files, like images and videos. 
    Plain text in HTML shows up as plain text in the browser.</p>
    <h3>Elements and Tags</h3><br>
    An element has an open and closed angle bracket with a keyword in between on both sides of a piece of text. <br>
    Opening tag has an open and closed angle bracket with a keyword in between and closing tag is like an opening one but with a / after the open bracket.<br>
    All whitespace or spaces, tabs and line breaks in this file was made using the p or br tag.<br>
    P was used to separate paragraphs and br was used to end a line.<br>
    Div tags are used to divide the page into different sections. It was used for the areas where there is a list.<br>
      <div>
           <h3>More Elements and Attributes</h3>
                <ul>
                   <li>Type Attribute variations</li>
                       <ol type="1">
                         <li>Numbers (1)</li>
                         <li>Uppercase letters (A)</li>
                         <li>Lowercase letters (a)</li>
                         <li>Uppercase Roman numerals (I)</li>
                         <li>Lowercase Roman numerals (i)</li>
                       </ol>
                </ul>
                       <ul> 
                          <li>a element stands for anchor and is for adding links.</li>
                          <li>after the a is a space then href equals and a full website url starting with http(s) in quotes.</li>
                          <li><strong>URL</strong> stands for Universal Resource Locator.</li>
                          <li>the quotation marks can also contain a file path.</li>
                          <li>img element which is used to add images</li>
                </ul>

               This file starts with a DOCTYPE to tell the browser to treat the document as modern HTML.<br>
               Next is an html tag which contains the language the user reads then file in.<br>
               Then a head tag which has the title and is inside the html tag.<br>
               Finally there is the body which is also inside the html element under the head tag. It contains all the information in my notes.
            
     </div>
    </body>
</html>
